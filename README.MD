Every single game on Steam is cracked by just having a steam_api emulator that takes all the calls and gives the application the illusion they're connected.
This is simple to bypass and should be obfuscated but the interesting part is this all runs as a replacement launcher for Unity so you can do your own cool looking thing referencing this code.
